<span id="id1"></span><h1>Volumes<a class="headerlink" href="#volumes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Besides skeletons CATMAID can also generate and display 3D meshes, which it
calls volumes. At the moment the support is basic, but can be useful already.
They are arbitrary triangle meshes or polyhedra, stored as PostGIS data for fast
access. Volumes are associated to projects and can currently not be shared
between them without data duplication.</p>
<p>The 3D Viewer&#8217;s &#8220;View settings&#8221; tab allows to mark known volumes as visible.
Checkboxes for individual volumes are accessible from a drop down menu. If a
volume becomes visible, it takes the currently selected opacity and color from
the color selector close to the drop down menu. If the &#8220;Faces&#8221; option is
selected, filled triangles are displayed rather than a wireframe.</p>
<p>And since CATMAID&#8217;s 3D viewer supports a textured Z plane, the volume&#8217;s
intersection with an image stack can be visually inspected as well. However,
there is not yet a way to show volumes as a layer in a stack viewer.</p>
<p>Volumes are also accessible from the Volume Manager widget, which can be opened
with the help of the 3D cube icon in the Tracing Tool&#8217;s button panel. It shows
all available volumes and some meta information on them. Double clicking table
entries allows users to edit basic information, like its name. Additionally, the
volume&#8217;s bounding box is displayed on top of the image data of the active stack
viewer. The mesh itself is not editable from CATMAID&#8217;s web-client at this point.</p>
<p>The volume widget also provides means to generate new volumes based on neurons,
synapses or simply as a bounding box. The sub-sections below provide some detail
on this.</p>
<p>Besides display, CATMAID can currently use volumes only to warn if nodes are
created outside of them. This is useful, for instance, if one wants to
constrain neuron reconstruction to a given compartment. To select a volume for
which warnings should be generated open the settings widget and open the
section called &#8220;Warnings&#8221;. If a volume is selected from the drop down menu,
warnings will be generated for the current session.</p>
<div class="section" id="volume-generation">
<h2>Volume generation<a class="headerlink" href="#volume-generation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In CATMAID, volumes can either be added through the volume manager or directly
through the HTTP API.</p>
<div class="section" id="volume-manager">
<h3>Volume manager<a class="headerlink" href="#volume-manager" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Pressing the &#8220;Add new volume&#8221; button brings up a user interface to generate and
add new volumes. The first thing to do is to select the new volume&#8217;s type,
available are bounding box, convex hull and alpha shape. The first is simply an
axis aligned box, previewed in the tracing layer. After configuration,
&#8220;Save&#8221; can be pressed to store the volume on the server. Bounding boxes are
currently the only volumes that can be edited after they have been created.</p>
<p>The remaining two volume types require a point set to operate on and can be
previewed in the 3D viewer (it will take the first one open). For both a
skeleton source can be selected on which different filters can further constrain
the set of treenodes that are actually used. This es especially useful if a
compartment is already reconstructed and a convex or concave hull describes it
reasonably well. The skeletons&#8217; treenodes can be used create volumes.
Alternatively, one can create new dummy neurons for the sole purpose pf volume
generation by roughly outlining a compartment.</p>
<p>Skeletons can contain a lot of treenodes. Therefore, to reduce computation
costs, and to provide more flexibility it is possible to apply filters to the
input set of treenodes (coming from the selected skeleton source). One could for
instance select only branch nodes, roots or connectors. It is possible to add
multiple filters at the same time. All filters work on the nodes of the
skeletons provided by the selected source. The results of all filters are
combined with, optionally different, set operations. A union merges both
results and takes all; an intersection only allows what is in both sets. This
happens in a left associative fashion (or, here, since a table representation
is used, &#8220;top associative&#8221;). Each filter operates on the same set of input
nodes and only their combination creates the final result.  By default, if no
filter is used, all nodes from the input skeletons are used.</p>
<p>To add a filter, select the type, configure it through the settings below the
type selection and press &#8220;Add new filter rule&#8221; and continue with the next filter.</p>
<p>An example: Add an &#8220;Only branch nodes&#8221; filter and then select a new type, say
Synaptic connections to other neurons and select a merge operation . For
synaptic connections, you now can select the partners (or choose None for any
partner) and the type of relation that is required. After the second filter is
added, you have a point set of branch nodes and connector nodes. Now you can go
ahead and adjust the actual volume properties, e.g. the alpha value (to filter
out particular tetrahedra, or optionally triangles).</p>
<p>Pressing the &#8220;Add new volume&#8221; button will generate the mesh. Keep in mind that
volumes are materialized after they are created and currently can&#8217;t be edited
after creation. The screenshot below is taken during the volume generation
using alpha shapes on a set of filtered skeletons. It shows a preview from the
Volume Manager and as can be seen, disconnected meshes are supported as well.</p>

<div class="section" id="api">
<h3>API<a class="headerlink" href="#api" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If wanted, volumes can also be created outside of CATMAID and then loaded into
into it through its HTTP API. As long as it is possible to
represent them as a generic triangle mesh, loading them into CATMAID
should be easy. The HTTP endpoint to use is:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>/{project_id}/volumes/add
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For more details on the API itself, consult the <a class="reference external" href="api">API documentation</a>,
which is available under <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/apis</span></code> on every CATMAID instance.</p>
<p>To store a volume through the API, you have to create a POST request which
contains the fields &#8220;type&#8221; (set to &#8220;trimesh&#8221;), &#8220;title&#8221; (a representative title)
and &#8220;mesh&#8221;. It is expected to be a string that encodes two lists in JSON
format: [[points], [triangles]]. The list of points contains lists of three
numbers, each one representing a vertex in the mesh. The array of triangles
also contains three element lists as items. Each one represents a triangle
based on the points in the other array, that are referenced by the triangle
index values. For instance, this would constitute a valid set of fields for the
creation request:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>title: &quot;Example mesh&quot;
type: &quot;trimesh&quot;
mesh: &quot;[[[0,0,0], [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [1,1,0]], [[0,1,2], [1,3,2]]]&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If everything went well, the endpoint should return a response with two JSON
fields: &#8220;success&#8221; (should be true) and &#8220;volume_id&#8221;, which holds he ID of the
newly created volume.</p>
<p>If you have an API token generated for your CATMAID user, you could also use
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">curl</span></code>, to load the mesh from a JSON file (having the fields above):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>curl -X POST -d @&lt;json-file&gt; &lt;catmaid_url&gt;/&lt;project_id&gt;/volumes/add \
  --header &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
  --header &quot;X-Authorization: Token &lt;api-token&gt;&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where &lt;catmaid_url&gt; is the URL of your CATMAID instance, &lt;json-file&gt; being the
file path to a JSON file representing the data to send (see above),
&lt;project_id&gt; is the project ID (visible when creating a link to a view) and
&lt;api-token&gt; being your <a class="reference external" href="api-token">API token</a>.</p>
